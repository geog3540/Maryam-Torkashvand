              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">The map clearly shows that the rate of white settlers in the united states was noticeably higher than nonwhite settlers in 1920.In fact, based on available data from census records, we can see that the major population of the United States was white people. However, some parts of the population of nonwhite people on the east coasts and southeast of the continental united states were relatively high. It is noticeable that the population rate of nonwhite and white people in northeastern counties of Arizona and a small part of New Mexico is relatively similar, with a higher portion of nonwhite settlers in Apache county. Also, the maps show that Alaska had a mostly nonwhite population. Moreover, although in some counties, 100 percent of the population was white, the percentage of nonwhite people never went higher than 87 percent. However, both races saw zero percent of the population.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">The map shows the number of families with five members in each state of the US who lived in 1930 based on census data. It is obvious that most of the large families (size of 5) lived in the northeast part of the united states. New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois were four states with the larger population of families with size 5. Overall most families with five members lived in the eastern region (east coast, south east, and east part of the great plain) of the united states. However, Texas in the south and California on the west coast had relatively large populations of five-member families. Also, the population of large families in northern states was very low.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">The map displays the relationship between the percentage of urban population and air quality (based on the average daily PM2.5) in Florida in 2010. It reveals that only in a small number of counties (six counties) does good air quality occur in areas with a high density of urban population. Furthermore, most of the counties with high air quality are located in the northern part of the state, where the percentage of urban population is generally low. Overall, although there are some exceptions, most counties demonstrate a positive correlation between poor air quality and a high percentage of urban population. We can also divide Florida into northern and southern regions: in most northern counties, the air quality is high, and the urban population is low. In contrast, in the majority of the southern region, the urban population is high, and the air quality is low.

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">The isarithmic map presenting yearly total precipitation in Iowa State displays a noticeable spatial pattern. It shows that the northeastern part of Iowa has the highest precipitation amounts, and these quantities reduce as we travel to the west and south. The map uses contour lines that connect areas with equal precipitation to help visualize this trend.This pattern of precipitation distribution is caused by a mix of factors, such as differences in the landscape, wind patterns, and how close the area is to sources of moisture. It is important to understand these patterns for various reasons, like planning for farming, managing water resources, and evaluating flood risks. By knowing the differences in precipitation across Iowa, people can make better decisions for their specific regions.

              <p class="card-text">This flow map shows the migration between migration regions in the U.S. from 1901 to 1924. The units are migration regions and flows are the number of families who migrant between regions. Overall, the map illustrates a balanced migration throughout the U.S. between 1901 and 1924. Nearly all regions both receive and send migrants and have direct interactions with each other. However, the highest volumes of flows are directed toward the west and south. States in southern regions, such as Texas, Alabama, Colorado, and Kansas, both receive from and send to other regions. The map also displays the nodes with the highest gross migration for the southern states.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">The map shows that there is a correlation between obesity and social and financial situations. As the small multiple maps illustrate, the northern counties in Florida, where access to exercise opportunities (such as gyms, pools, parks, etc.) is limited, have a higher percentage of adults who suffer from obesity. This is also true for the relationship between counties with high unemployment rates and high obesity rates. However, it seems that the income ratio variable does not have as extensive an impact as unemployment and exercise opportunities on adult obesity issues.</p>
